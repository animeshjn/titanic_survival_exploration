Predictions 3 Exploration notes
finding when females are least likely to survive:

-Based on Age the data is mixed 
-Based on Age and Pclass the data shows clear distinction
- Plotting numbers / Age when Pclass =3 shows that all the females from age 40-50 in class 3 did not survived. 
- hence the condition which improves accuracy

finding when Males are most likely to survive

-Most of the Males with Age less than 10 survived
-Most of the Males with Age less than 10 who did not survived belongs to Pclass = 3 category so those can be eliminated.


Variables tried to change to predict:
Pclass, Parch,  SibSp, Age
While combination of Parch with others were not that distinguishable where as predictions with Pclass and its combination with Age and 

Statistical Method Used:
Decision Tree on features Sex, Age and Pclass
 
Implementation:
 The deision tree is implemented using if - elif - else ladder (conditional statements) in the prediction3 model.
